/**
 * Generated type definitions for this contract version
 * 
 * Currently a placeholder. Future versions may export TypeScript interfaces
 * derived from contract metadata.
 * 
 * TODO: Generate TypeScript interfaces for:
 * - Composite types (structs) used in events
 * - Variant types (enums) with proper discriminated unions
 * - Type aliases (AccountId32, Balance, etc.) for better type safety
 * - Helper types for Option<T> and Result<T, E>
 * 
 * @generated - Do not edit manually, regenerate with gen-ink-decoder.js
